VALIDATION FOLDER

Folder Definition : A line of defense that confirms the correct data is being sent to the backend. Like a bouncer at a club. 

Zod Library Definition : Zod schemas define what a valid input looks like.

Functions : 
    Examples : 
    /folder.js
        export const folderCreate = z.object = object requires an object

        folderCreate.partial(); = Partial turns off required on folderCreate. Keeps the rules, but makes inputs optional.
        folderUpdate.extend({ id: z.string().uuid() }) = Extends adds fields to an existing object, by default zod sets fields as required.  
        folderUpdate.refine = Refine adds functions to define specific rules.

    /reminders.js
        const optionalDate = z.preprocess = Expect raw data, normalize it, then define rules before accepting. 

        remindersUpdate.omit({ subListId: true }) = Omit means replace a value of an existing field. In this case the sublist key. 






    Types : 
        .string() = Accept strings
        .uuid() = Accept id
        .min(1, x) = Accept atleast 1 character
        .strict() = Only accept the previously deifned object values
